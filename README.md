# Maintenance and Current State

**Not actively maintained** since I'm switching to Quadlets instead of the `compose`-based configuration I was making use of when working on this. I was already using Podman, so the switch makes a lot of sense for me.

The application is **incomplete** but it did work well enough for my use cases. What exists in this repository right now was intended to serve as a prototype and I intended to rewrite it by hand, either entirely or mostly, once I had some implementation details thought out well enough.

For anyone interested enough, here's some of the stuff I was experimenting with here:

- **Go**: Go, as a whole, is pretty new to me.
- **GoReleaser and svu**: Liked it. But I think my conclusion is that Semantic Versioning and Conventional Commits aren't great for anything that's not a library.
- **Single binary with embedded FS**: I like the idea of a single binary that can serve as the web server, the TUI, and the CLI. It worked pretty well. I especially like how easy Go makes it to embed content (like my Next.js frontend).
- **Improved developer workflows**: Just some stuff to make development on an application like this easier. Refer to the `justfile` if interested.

Where I planned for this to go:

- Remove the TUI. It was pretty buggy and never quite worked the way I wanted it to. Moreover, I almost always preferred to use the CLI anyway.
- Separate `Hosts` and `Buckets` into two different sets of configuration since there can technically be multiple buckets on a host and it's just a neater logical separation.
    - This would have been an opportunity to rewrite it.
- Complete the web UI and API. It's currently in a very incomplete state.
- Package as a container.

# ðŸª£ Bucket Manager (bm)

**Bucket Manager** is a tool for managing compose stacks across local and remote machines. It offers three interfaces to fit your workflow: CLI for automation, TUI for interactive management, and a web interface for visual control.

## Features

- **Simple & Intuitive** - Works just like you'd expect it to
- **Local & Remote** - Manage stacks anywhere via SSH
- **Multiple Interfaces** - CLI, TUI, and Web UI
- **Real-time Updates** - Live status monitoring
- **Zero Configuration** - Auto-discovers your compose stacks
- **Tab Completion** - Fast command completion for the CLI

## Quick Start

1. **Install:**

    ```bash
    just install
    ```

    This installs the `bm` binary to `~/.local/bin/` (make sure this is in your `$PATH`). Actual path reference [here](https://docs.rs/dirs/latest/dirs/fn.executable_dir.html).

2. **Choose your interface:**
    - **CLI:** `bm list`, `bm up my-stack`
    - **TUI:** `bm` (with no arguments for interactive mode)
    - **Web UI:** `bm serve` then visit http://localhost:8080

## Core Features

- Control stacks (start, stop, update, refresh) individually or in bulk
- View current stack status (Up, Down, Partial, Error)
- SSH support for remote management

## Stack Commands

| Command                         | Description                           |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `bm list`                       | List all stacks                       |
| `bm up <stack> [stack...]`      | Start one or more stacks              |
| `bm down <stack> [stack...]`    | Stop one or more stacks               |
| `bm pull <stack> [stack...]`    | Pull latest images                    |
| `bm refresh <stack> [stack...]` | Full refresh (pull, down, up)         |
| `bm status [stack]`             | Show status of all or specific stacks |
| `bm prune [hosts]`              | Clean up unused resources             |

## Stack Naming

Stacks can be referenced in three ways:

1. **Full name:** `server:stack-name` (e.g., `local:app` or `server1:api`)
2. **Short name:** `stack-name` (tries local first, then remote)
3. **Server only:** `server:` (only for `bm status`, e.g., `bm status server1:`)

Tab completion helps find the right names.

## Stack Discovery

Bucket Manager automatically discovers compose stacks in the following locations:

**Default Paths:**

- **Local:** `~/bucket` or `~/compose-bucket`
- **Remote:** Same paths on configured SSH hosts

**Custom Paths:**

- **Local:** Use `bm config set-local-root <path>` to change the search directory
- **Remote:** Configure per-host paths when adding hosts with `bm config ssh add` or `bm config ssh edit`

All locations are searched for `compose.yaml`, `compose.yml`, `docker-compose.yaml`, and `docker-compose.yml` files.

## Interfaces

### Web Interface

Run `bm serve` to start the web interface on http://localhost:8080, offering:

- Modern graphical interface for stack management
- Real-time status updates
- Remote host configuration
- Command output streaming

### TUI

The text interface (`bm` with no arguments) provides:

- Interactive navigation with keyboard shortcuts
- Multi-stack selection and operations
- Real-time status updates
- SSH configuration management (`c` key)
- Host pruning

### CLI

#### Shell Completion

Install tab completion for your shell:

```bash
# For Fish shell
mkdir -p ~/.config/fish/completions
bm completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/bm.fish
```

For other shells, replace `fish` with `bash`, `zsh`, or `powershell` and the appropriate path.

#### Container Runtime

Bucket Manager supports both Podman (default) and Docker as container runtimes:

```bash
# Set runtime to Docker
bm config set-runtime docker

# Set runtime to Podman (default)
bm config set-runtime podman

# Check current runtime
bm config get-runtime
```

The runtime affects all stack operations. Make sure your compose files are compatible with the chosen runtime.

#### SSH Configuration

Manage remote hosts:

- `bm config ssh list` - Show all hosts
- `bm config ssh add` - Add a new host
- `bm config ssh edit` - Edit an existing host
- `bm config ssh import` - Import from ~/.ssh/config

#### Examples

```bash
# Start a local stack
bm up myapp

# Start multiple stacks at once
bm up myapp frontend server1:api

# Start a stack on a remote server
bm up server1:api

# Check all stack statuses
bm status

# Check statuses on just one server
bm status server1:

# Complete refresh of a stack (pull, down, up)
bm refresh myapp

# Refresh multiple stacks at once
bm refresh myapp frontend server1:api server2:database

# Clean up Docker resources locally
bm prune local
```
